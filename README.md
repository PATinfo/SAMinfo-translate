# README

This repository contains the `*.properties` files of the SAMinfo-tomcat repository. The purpose of this repository is to provide
easy access to those files for their translation in other languages. Each language is represented by its UNIX *locale*
internationalisation code. Are currently supported:

-   de-ch (Swiss German)
-   de-de (German)
-   en-uk (British English)
-   en-us (American English)
-   fr-ch (Swiss French)
-   fr-fr (French)

Note that the gold master -- or reference language, is _Swiss French_.
